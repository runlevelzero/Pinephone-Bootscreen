# PinePhone Plymouth Theme

--

This is a plymouth bootscreen based off of the current bootscreen for the debian+phosh image for the pinephone based off some of the guidelines listed in this [Gnome Boot Progress design sheet](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/BootProgress)

I used the Monterrat font as it is the font that Pine64 uses all over their front page, it doesn't look bad, and the font is licensed under the Open Font License

Included in this particular branch is the Mobian logo, beautifully generated by the [Mobian team](https://gitlab.com/mobian1)

Additionally, the spinner assets were taken from the default Ubuntu Plymouth theme found in Ubuntu 20.04, if this is a violation of the terms of the license, I will substitute the spinner for a couple varieties later on down the road.

If you want to use this theme on other pinephone distrobutions, all you need to do is add in a logo file and edit the logo call in the flavour text section of the script file
