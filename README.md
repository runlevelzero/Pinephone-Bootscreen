# PinePhone Plymouth Theme

This is a plymouth bootscreen based off of the current bootscreen for the debian+phosh image for the pinephone based off some of the guidelines listed in this [Gnome Boot Progress design sheet](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/BootProgress)

I used the Monterrat font as it is the font that Pine64 uses all over their front page, it doesn't look bad, and the font is licensed under the Open Font License

Included in this particular branch is the Mobian logo, beautifully generated by the [Mobian team](https://gitlab.com/mobian1)

Additionally, the spinner assets were taken from the default Ubuntu Plymouth theme found in Ubuntu 20.04, if this is a violation of the terms of the license, I will substitute the spinner for a couple varieties later on down the road.

If you want to use this theme on other pinephone distrobutions, all you need to do is add in a logo file and edit the logo call in the flavour text section of the script file

While this repository is set up for debian packaging, if you clone the repo, you can take the plymouth theme and place it in your plymouth directory (This is usually found in `/usr/share/plymouth/themes`)

then you will need to edit your plymouth config file found in `/etc/plymouth` to set the theme to `pinephoneBH`

then you will need to run whatever commands to update your initramfs
You could probably get away with just running `sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R pinephoneBH`
but you may have to run additional commands depending on how your os is set up
